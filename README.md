# Refugee Stories

Trello board [here](https://trello.com/b/oefRAN7q/refugee-2)

## Overview

### Pitch

People visiting the site will gain a better understanding of the refugee crisis and what it means to be a refugee. There are more people displaced in the world today than at any time since the end of World War II and it is more important than ever to help people develop empathy for each other.

### MVP

As an admin I can log in and approve or reject submitted stories.
As a refugee I can come to the site and submit my story without logging in.

#### MVP Features Breakdown

* [ ] **Home Page** Contains a carousel of 3 sets of pictures and highlighted quotes from recently posted stories with a read more button, linked to full story.

* [ ] **Login Page** After an admin logs in, they'll be directed to a page of recently submitted stories. Here they can click approve and the story will appear on the stories page, or reject and it will be deleted.

* [ ] **Navigation** Navigation is present on all pages, Users should know what page is active by clicking on a nav link and activating their tab.Tabs should include about us, submit your story, stories, and connect (if you choose to do the stretch goal).

* [ ] **Stories Page** Contains a grid of all recently submitted stories.

* [ ] **Submit Your Story Page** Clicking add story brings up a page with a self contained form where a user can add their story. Clicking submit adds the story to a que for the admin to review.

### Stretch

* [ ] Create a connect page that shows a Google map to show the nearest refugee organizations near you to volunteer with.

  <summary>Tools for building our own</summary>

* [Styled Components](https://www.styled-components.com/)
* [Emotion](https://emotion.sh/) and [Linaria](https://linaria.now.sh/) have nearly identical API to Styled Components, with different trade-offs
* [React Sketch.app](http://airbnb.io/react-sketchapp/) for keeping design in sync. Not sure how useful this would be, but it allows you to generate a rendering of your React Components in a Sketch document.
* [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com) for icons
* [Humaaans](https://www.humaaans.com/) if we want to add customizable illustrations
